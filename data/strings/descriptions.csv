arc_tiferet,SHIP,"""Harmony"" - The backbone of Archotech Research fleets, the Tiferet-pattern frigate hides a surprising amount of firepower in the form of three medium mounts and four missile launchers under thick laminated armor plate. It has lots of tactical flexibility thanks to it's light Burst Phase Core, allowing the otherwise lumbering frigate the mobility of a strike craft.

This overgunned frigate fits perfectly into the ARC's standing doctrine of quality over quantity, given that on ARC’s focus on survivability and ending fights quickly. Designed in c95 during the initial founding of the ARC, the Tiferet was used as a strike/scout unit for ARC’s deep space exploratory fleets.

All ARC ships are designed to be operated by quality crews, and crew protection is paramount since the ARC cannot stand to lose any personnel on long-range deep-space exploratory missions. An integrated downscaled coronal hypershunt, a device unique to ARC ships, provides power to a robust set of flux circuits, at the risk of very long overload times. 

NOTABLE HULLS:
T-013B ""Ali's Fist""
     Notable for mounting Reapers on the broadside launcher mounts. The captain insists that the ability to do a ""drive-by barrage"" is a tactically sound move.

T-022C ""Porcupine Plushie""
    The first test of a PD variant of the Tiferet. Was deemed effective enough, though combat logs indicate the crew's knack of often getting into its escorted ship's line of fire.

arc_daat,SHIP,"""Knowledge"" - The Daat-Pattern Spec Ops Destroyer is an armored craft whose main feature is a large articulated weapon mount. The large hybrid mount gives it multi-mission capability. A small hangar capable of housing a wing of Wanzers, a complement of medium mounts, ample PD, and micro-missiles round out this flexible and powerful ship.

A bit oversized for a destroyer, the Daat went through several design changes. It was initially envisioned by the ARC Design Team as a test-bed for a modular phase coil technology. However, the strategic insistence on relying on a coronal hypershunt core precluded this since there was no more space inside the hull. Thus, the design was scrapped, and the space for the phase coil was hollowed out, the void intended to house a spinal mounted weapon. This made the design susceptible to frontal attacks since there was not enough hull and armor to protect the prow, so finally an articulated mount was put into place, where the gun is actually supported, oriented, and recoil-compensated by several load-bearing flux-dynamic pistons. It was thought to be more fragile than standard turret rings at first, but the simplicity of the pistons' operation ensured that maintenance and repairs are easily done with a limited amount of manpower, and the lack of a turret ring ensured that the hull stayed within stress limits, if only just. Thus, the Daat was pressed into service as a front-line destroyer capable of punching abouve its weight.

All ARC ships are designed to be operated by quality crews, and crew protection is paramount since the ARC cannot stand to lose any personnel on long-range deep-space exploratory missions. An integrated downscaled coronal hypershunt, a device unique to ARC ships, provides power to a robust set of flux circuits, at the risk of very long overload times. 

NOTABLE HULLS
D-04 ""Ranger""
     This hull had a modified Gauss Cannon equipped, which can fire six rounds in fast succession. Firing the ""Big Iron"" stressed the flux circuits almost into redline, but the captain and the crew swear on its efficacy. Combat logs indicate a lot of critical hits on target armor and hull, so the claim may have some truth to it.",,,
arc_gevurah,SHIP,"""Strength"" - Big, bulky and reliable. the Gevurah-Pattern Frontline Cruiser relies on its AM Barrage Cannon to deal damage, while two Wanzer wings swoop in and provide interference or bombing. A cluster of six medium weapon mounts with excellent coverage provide secondary armament and an adequate number of small mounts provide good PD coverage. Two sets of four-tube micro missile launchers provide excellent suppression capability.

The ARC Strategic Planning Team had noted the need for a front line cruiser which can operate with only a limited escort for extended periods of time. Thus, the Design Team came up with the Gevurah, and in an unusual twist, in record time too. With thicker than usual bulkheads, great armor coverage, a cheap logistical profile, and a reliable set of weaponry, the Gevurah fills that need and more. The Gevurah forms the backbone of the ARC's admittedly tiny fleets - without it, defeat is sure to be close by.

Though boring and practical, all ARC captains and crews swear by the Gevurah for its reliability and crew protection, and almost all ARC high ranking navy officers had a successful stint at commanding one.

All ARC ships are designed to be operated by quality crews, and crew protection is paramount since the ARC cannot stand to lose any personnel on long-range deep-space exploratory missions. An integrated downscaled coronal hypershunt, a device unique to ARC ships, provides power to a robust set of flux circuits, at the risk of very long overload times. 

NOTABLE HULLS:
G-00 ""Jormugandr""
    The first Gevurah-class ship ever produced, the Jormugandr has a decorated history. It has participated in the Sivie Incursion, having been the spearhead in several raids. It was also the flagship in the first long-range expedition by the ARC to the southern reaches, where the Jormugandr, during a rear-guard action following a withdrawal in a [REDACTED], single-handedly destroyed a pursuing [REDACTED] battlecruiser.",,,
arc_netzach,SHIP,"""Victory"" - The darling child of the ARC, the Netzach-Pattern Battlecarrier is a ship with lots of potential and tactical flexibility. A heavily armed ship, it can pierce armor with its Sunspear cannons and suppress enemies with twin Macross Missile Launchers. For fast on-demand battlefield movement, a Burst Phase system allows it to momentarily slip through phase space. Four Wanzer wings and a good variety of mounts complete this capable ship.

The Netzach is the very first ship class to be designed and produced wholly by the ARC Design Team. After the ARC's violent and disastrous debut in the First Sivie Uprising, it was determined that the ARC cannot and should not rely on ships produced by the very enemies who sought to destroy them. The Design Team, lead by Science Director [REDACTED], bought, stole and hacked whatever technical blueprints they can gather from Diable Avionics facilities and designed a capital ship with the firepower to engage targets above its weight, the tactical flexibility required by independent operations, and the speed to flee for safety if the situation demands it. But due to the ARC's near-total defeat, resources and morale were at a premium, and the project languished for some years. 

It took the heroic efforts of Recon Team Leader [REDACTED], who tracked, located and retrieved a Domain coronal hypershunt device - the very first instance recovered Post-Collapse. The resulting industrial boom allowed the ARC to produce the first (and currently only) Netzach hull. Not to waste a great opportunity, the ARC Design Team, after a string of near-miraculous discoveries, managed to replicate a tiny fraction of the coronal hypershunt's capability, and used the resulting device as the Netzach's power core. This downscaled coronal hypershunt device could be replicated (and thus was jealously guarded), and served as the core technology around which the ARC builds their ship designs.

Being a design and production pathfinder, the Netzach has many design quirks and odd internal features. Thus, upon transfer crews are commanded to fully read and internalize their station's operation manuals - much mission time has been lost due to crews hunting for manuals for an unfamiliar procedure or device.

All ARC ships are designed to be operated by quality crews, and crew protection is paramount since the ARC cannot stand to lose any personnel on long-range deep-space exploratory missions. An integrated downscaled coronal hypershunt, a device unique to ARC ships, provides power to a robust set of flux circuits, at the risk of very long overload times. 

NOTABLE HULLS:
N-00 ""Lohengrin""
    The first and only known instance of the Netzach class ship. It served as the flagship during the Sivie Incursion, and held the line long enough for the rescue and exfiltration missions to be done safely.",,,
arc_sephiroth,SHIP,"""Manifestation"" - The latest in ARC design, the Sephirot-Pattern Dreadnought is made to be the tip of the armed spear-thrust of the ARC into Remnant-controlled deep space. It was originally meant to be an upgunned Netzach, and the design does share several similarities such as hull layout, an upgraded Sunspear Mk2, and the same dual Macross Missile Launchers as the Netzach. But that's where the similarities end. The turret mount count is triple compared to the Netzach, and an Overdrive Core is installed, which, when activated, dilates the hypershunt pinhole to feed dangerously high levels to the ship’s thrusters and weapons. This makes the Sephiroth a very dangerous ship, both for the crew, and triply so for the enemy.

Having had encounters with some of the horrors of deep space, particularly the [REDACTED]-class guardian ships of [REDACTED], the Design Bureau mandated the creation of a dreadnought-class ship which can act as both the command and control center of the ARC Deep Space Exploration Fleet, and the final line of defense when the inevitable occurs and the battle-line dissolves under [REDACTED] onslaught. The Overdrive Core was originally designed to increase the firing rate of the ship’s weapons and provide massive amounts of defensive firepower at a moment’s notice, but the massive influx of energy from the core during activation was too much for pretty much any flux grid imaginable. So, instead of downscaling the core to manageable levels, the decision was made to change the ship’s fighting doctrine itself by redirecting excess amounts of power into the thrusters, making the ship lunge forward at very high speeds in a barely controlled manner – and bring all that firepower into the enemy formation at dangerously point-blank range. 

This caused much consternation in the ranks of the ARC, since this means that the fleet’s core command was itself at risk during combat. However, this instead had a rallying effect on ARC fleets – the fearlessness of how fleet commanders themselves led breakthrough maneuvers into enemy battle lines did wonders for fleet morale. This was demonstrated to great effect during the fleet action in Beta Lyrae’s corona, where a Sephiroth managed to outmaneuver two [REDACTED] guardian craft and take down their shields, allowing the fleet to snatch victory from defeat.

All ARC ships are designed to be operated by quality crews, and crew protection is paramount since the ARC cannot stand to lose any personnel on long-range deep-space exploratory missions. An integrated downscaled coronal hypershunt, a device unique to ARC ships, provides power to a robust set of flux circuits, at the risk of very long overload times.
