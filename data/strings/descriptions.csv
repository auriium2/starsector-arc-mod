urs_catastrophe,SHIP,"The Catastrophe is a ship designed for the sole purpose of cracking enemy defences. Often deployed alongside lighter fleet units of URS fleet command, these Cruisers usually sit back and lay down devastation on enemy Line Ships and static defences from a safe distance while the more dynamic fleet elements exploit the mayhem it creates. While somewhat vulnerable to being overwhelmed, they are very dangerously armed for their size, especially if they are allowed to control the range of their engagements.",,,
urs_flag,SHIP,"The pride of URS engineering and a result of questionably singular design philosophy, the Flag is the signature craft of URS built entirely around the Wyrmthunder Rail Cannon; one of the very first natively-designed vessels by the corporate weapons developer. 

With vast sections of the internals dedicated to fully utilising the rail cannon, it greatly lacks in defensive mounting options, and the tiny hull lacks significant hull reinforcement to make way for the raingun infrastructure. It is advised only the most skilled officers and crews take this delicate and eccentric ship into combat.
",,,
urs_darner,SHIP,"The Darner was developed after the completion of the Flag to downscale the Wyrmthunder Rail Cannon and allow the resulting weapon to quickly flank larger and slower vessels. Few have even been built due to the engineering challenges in construction and high maintenance of fitting a high-power rail cannon into a small form factor.

Though it's a swift strike frigate of outstanding mobility and firepower, much of the available hull space for armour and structural reinforcement has been taken up by the incorporation of the Wyrmfire Rail Cannon, leaving it incredibly fragile and prone to falling prey to fighter swarms or missile attacks.
",,,
urs_setter,SHIP,"The standard by which most URS ships are measured, the Setter sports a medium hardpoint at the bow and a defence-capable rear section, making it an unusually versatile Frigate for a URS design. A well-rounded and reliable design, it serves as an entry-level vessel for URS commissioned captains to gain early experience with their equipment, Setters can be found in most URS fleets as capable harassers and escort vessels operating in concert with other more specialised URS Frigate models.",,,
urs_gunbird,SHIP,"The Gunbird was designed as a mainstay attack frigate with a full-forward battery of weapons on a fast and agile platform. As with many Union-designed ships, much of the defence considerations were put aside for a greater offence; delegating that role to other ships in the fleet. An accelerated ammo feeder was installed in the already tight hull of the Gunbird, allowing it to have some obscene alpha strike potential. While the Gunbird is a ferocious attacker, much like the Darner it relies on wolf-pack tactics for its own defence.",,,
urs_moth,SHIP,"The Moth represents something of a break from traditional Frigate combat doctrine for URS; yet it fills a vitally important role for URS flotillas and strike groups. Developed as a direct response to high tech Fighter suppression tactics employed by Tri-Tachyon: the Moth features a comprehensive suite of slaved Delta Cores, devoted entirely to operating point defence systems at peak efficiency and operating its in-built drones.

These ships have little combat potential beyond sweeping the void clean of enemy strike craft and missile ordnance, but they have become a firm favourite for many, especially when assigned to convoy duties.",,,
urs_vexilla,SHIP,"Developed alongside the Moth as a counter to fighter and missile based suppression tactics, the Vexilla incorporates many of the same systems and doctrinal ideals into a much larger and more potent frame. Featuring three times the effective firepower of its small cousin, the Vexilla is no less effective in clearing the void of pests, but also represents a far more dire threat for would-be raiders on URS supply and salvage operations.",,,
urs_anarchy,SHIP,"The Anarchy is the bread and butter heavy support vessel for URS. Capable of a variety of offensive and defensive combat roles, they are often seen as the centre piece to smaller flotillas, and effective combat support vessels in even the largest battlegroups deployed by URS Fleet Command. While extremely potent as a combat vessel, it’s worth noting the Anarchy is very fragile for a ship of its weight class, reliant on its excellent shielding and mobility to keep itself operable in sustained combat.",,,
,,,,,
urs_pixie,SHIP,"The Mk1 model of combat drone, aptly nic-named the ‘Pixie’, is the primary production model of combat drone for URS. Cheap and easily replaced, being little more than a gun and an engine coded with simple attack and defence algorithms; these are often deployed in teeming swarms to choke the life out of enemy fighter squadrons and provide close-in defence for URS fleet assets.

The ‘A’ series Pixie drones are fitted with a mini-stapler and are designed to maximise the simplicity of design inherent to the Mk1 drones. They are the most common variant seen available through URS arms dealers.",,,
,,,,,
urs_wyrmflare,WEAPON,"Whilst in essence a simple upscaled Wyrmthunder, the Wyrmflare brings forth an entire magnitude greater destruction in its wake. The shear size and heat of the projectile produced during its magnetic propulsion and deceleration on hit is enough to melt away armour plating and cause far breaching fire damage. ",,,
urs_wyrmthunder,WEAPON,"A devastating weapon firing large metal projectiles at sub-relativistic speeds, greatly limited by the heavy capacitors and consequence disposable heatsinks for it to function at such output. The Wyrmthunder Rail Cannon was designed to be built into the Flag from early concept due to major power requirements and the general exploration for a high-mobility heavy weapons platform.

An absurdity dreamed up by a group of extremely enthusiastic scientists and engineers not long before the collapse, its development was funded in secrecy by a few motivated wealthy individuals who saw the potential in its ability to quickly tear through shields and still hold effect on armour. The first prototype saw completion in the decades to follow. The Flag was later designed with the Wyrmthunder as its central point, following the Union's doctrine of highly mobile spacecrafts capable of threatening well above their class. The metal projectiles aren't particularly remarkable other than their size, but the speed at which they travel is enough to shear through armour and leave devastation in its wake due to pressure heating the round and armour to absurd temperatures, continuing well into hull sections.

Whispers of complaints are constant amongst maintenance crews due to the unending quality assurance checks and high maintenance of the weapon, especially given the cramped hull and few available crew members.",,,
urs_wyrmfire,WEAPON,"A crushing weapon that is capable in punching through shields and armour alike. Much like its predecessor, it's limited by its need for powerful capacitors and heatsinks, and high power requirements demand the Darner to be built around the Wyrmfire in its entirety.",,,
urs_magneticstapler,WEAPON,"A point defence weapon capable of spitting out hundreds of flechettes through its rails in seconds. Ammo starved, it's incapable of its full sustained output by itself.

Conceptualised during a light quarrel in a discussion of research done centuries past and the topic of paper weights was brought up. The idea of punching thin strips of metal was taken far in excess of its original intent as the designers became obsessive in seeing this weapon brought the field. ",,,
urs_magneticstaplerbattery,WEAPON,"The Rail Stapler Battery is little more than a pair of Rail Staplers twinned together and hooked up to a more efficient power supply, granting superior range and volume of fire over the smaller model. Although the high demand for ammo means, like its smaller cousin, it struggles to meet its full destructive potential.",,,
urs_magneticshredder,WEAPON,"The Magnetic Shredder takes the principle of the Rail Stapler and scales it up into absurdity. This weapon array fires much heavier munitions than its smaller cousins over greater distances, permitting it to defend against a wide variety of enemies. Even light warships have much to fear from the Shredder. Although, also like its smaller cousins, it is hampered by its insatiable appetite for ammunition.",,,
urs_magneticcoiler,WEAPON,"A standard-setter in Railgun technology, the Magnetic Coiler is the basic mass production model Railgun that is Union Rail-System’s primary product. The coiler accelerates a slug of super-sence transuranic metal at relativistic speeds, long ranged for its size and mightily effective for shield suppression.

Although it’s not intended to be fired at heavy armour, the sheer force of the impact as well as electromagnetic interference caused by the slug’s material when it is flash-vaporised on contact with a target, mean it can be moderately effective at penetrating armour. Although the coiler is very powerful for its size, the limitations of its mount and tiny mass of the coiler’s slug projectiles limit its destructive potential against larger targets.",,,
urs_magneticcoilerbattery,WEAPON,"An upscaled model of the common Magnetic Coiler with more powerful magnets and an additional driver, aimed at rectifying some of the shortcomings of the original. A much greater volume of fire and superior longer range than the smaller model allow it to more effectively present a serious threat to larger vessels where it excels at shield suppression, but the upgrades come at a higher cost both in flux and on the market.",,,
urs_impactdriver,WEAPON,"The Impact Driver is a weapon that was initially developed as a tool for cracking asteroids from a safe distance, both to protect logistical centres from the hazards of the void and to help facilitate mining operations. However it was quickly adopted for frontline use when it was found these drivers were just as effective at smashing apart the hulls of Pirate raiders as they were at destroying the asteroids they loved to hide amongst.",,,
urs_heavyimpactdriver,WEAPON,"Following the surprise success of the Impact Driver, effort was put into an initiative to produce a purpose-built ship killer following the same design principle. The Heavy Impact Driver is the product of such a development process, simply scaling up the older design for Capital ship deployment, and it presents an existential danger to any ship caught in its effective range with its heavy slugs.",,,
urs_assaultdriver,WEAPON,"Built to support the aggressive Hit and Fade tactics often employed by URS SpecOps detachments, the Assault Driver is URS’s home-grown take on the tried and tested assault gun formula.

These Drivers are lighter than what is standard issue for warships, but are fitted to a highly sophisticated autoloading system allowing it to fire extremely rapidly despite its lacking range and power; after a short charge time for the magnets. Although such a rate of fire is very demanding on ammunition storage, it struggles to reach its full potential without hull modifications.",,,
urs_haywireboltthrower,WEAPON,"The Haywire Bolt Thrower is little more than a simple low-power magnetic rail system built for the sole purpose of delivering Haywire ‘bolts’ to the enemy. These bolts, however, are anything but simple. These small, and at first seemingly mundane, spiked poles are not inert pieces of metal; but are charged with high capacity batteries designed to unload into and wreak havoc on hostile systems if allowed to make contact with an enemy vessel’s hull. These same energies can place severe strain on a target's shield systems. The only limitation of these weapon systems is their low-power nature. While affordable, it’s very limited in range and rate of fire.",,,
urs_haywireboltthrowerarray,WEAPON,"Another, much larger and more powerful, delivery system for Haywire Bolts. The Haywire Bolt Thrower Array aims to rectify the shortcomings of the original Bolt Thrower design by linking several magnetic rail systems together and feeding much greater power into them; dramatically increasing the volume of fire in bursts as well as improving effective strike range substantially.",,,
urs_gaussrepeater,WEAPON,"Built on a miniaturized gauss platform optimised for mobility and accuracy over sheer range and power. The Gauss Repeater is a general-use defense system utilized by the URS. Originally commissioned by th URS corporation in response to growing concerns form URS officers and captains about the growing number of fighters and bombers faced in combat.

The contract for the weapon system was awarded to the Heavy Electrics Group. The prokect demanded a High-End, bleeding edge, long range point-defense system. HEG chose the Magnetic Coiler to act as a basis for the weapons system, retooling it to fire magnetically-contained bolts of Phased Plasma as opposed to physical rods of transuranic metal. HEG then combined the weapon system with advanced target acquisition software, overclocked turret gyros and a magazine feeding system.

The result was expensive, but proved to be a pin-point accurate long range defense weapon that packed an incredible punch for a weapon of its size and type. The Guass Repeater has found itself primarily as a long range fighter-focused defense system, especially on larger ship classes in service with the corporation.",,,
